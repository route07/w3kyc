# Smart Contract Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Environment Setup
- [ ] Route07 network configured in MetaMask
- [ ] Test tokens available for gas fees
- [ ] Remix IDE ready
- [ ] Contract code copied to Remix

### ✅ Contract Verification
- [ ] Contract compiles without errors
- [ ] All dependencies resolved
- [ ] Docstrings fixed and validated
- [ ] Security review completed

### ✅ Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Owner wallet address ready
- [ ] Gas estimation completed
- [ ] Network connection stable
- [ ] Backup plan prepared

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Remix Setup
```bash
# 1. Open Remix IDE
# 2. Create new workspace: "KYC-Contracts"
# 3. Create file: KYCVerification.sol
# 4. Copy contract code from contracts/KYCVerification.sol
```

### Step 2: Compilation
```bash
# 1. Go to Solidity Compiler tab
# 2. Set compiler version: 0.8.19
# 3. Enable optimization: 200 runs
# 4. Click "Compile KYCVerification.sol"
# 5. Verify no errors or warnings
```

### Step 3: Deployment
```bash
# 1. Go to Deploy & Run Transactions tab
# 2. Environment: "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
# 3. Account: Select Route07 account
# 4. Contract: KYCVerification
# 5. Constructor Parameters:
#    - initialOwner: [YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS]
# 6. Click "Deploy"
# 7. Confirm in MetaMask
```

### Step 4: Verification
```bash
# 1. Copy deployed contract address
# 2. Test basic functions:
#    - getKYCStatus([TEST_ADDRESS])
#    - isKYCValid([TEST_ADDRESS])
# 3. Verify owner is set correctly
# 4. Test pause/unpause functionality
```

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### ✅ Contract Configuration
- [ ] Authorize verifier addresses
- [ ] Test all main functions
- [ ] Verify event emissions
- [ ] Check gas costs

### ✅ Documentation Update
- [ ] Update .env.local with contract address
- [ ] Document deployment transaction hash
- [ ] Record gas costs
- [ ] Update deployment guide

### ✅ Integration Testing
- [ ] Test blockchain integration
- [ ] Verify ABI compatibility
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Monitor events

## Contract Addresses

After deployment, update your `.env.local`:

```env
# Smart Contract Addresses
KYC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x... # Deployed KYCVerification contract
```

## Testing Commands

### Basic Function Tests
```solidity
// Test KYC verification
verifyKYC(0x123..., "QmTestHash", 25)

// Test status retrieval
getKYCStatus(0x123...)

// Test wallet linking
linkWallet(0x123..., 0x456...)

// Test audit logging
createAuditLog(0x123..., "TEST", "Test details")
```

### Admin Function Tests
```solidity
// Test verifier authorization
authorizeVerifier(0x789...)

// Test pause functionality
pause()
unpause()

// Test ownership
owner()
```

## Emergency Procedures

### If Deployment Fails
1. Check gas limit and increase if needed
2. Verify network connection
3. Check account balance
4. Try with higher gas price

### If Contract Has Issues
1. Document the problem
2. Check contract state
3. Consider redeployment
4. Update documentation

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Deployment Success
- [ ] Contract deployed successfully
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] All functions working
- [ ] Events emitting correctly
- [ ] Gas costs acceptable

### ✅ Integration Success
- [ ] Frontend can connect to contract
- [ ] API routes working with blockchain
- [ ] Error handling working
- [ ] Performance acceptable

## Notes

- Keep deployment transaction hash for reference
- Monitor gas usage during testing
- Document any issues encountered
- Update team with deployment status

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Proceed to Phase 3: Backend API Development
2. Test blockchain integration
3. Build API routes
4. Create frontend components
